                    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my website</h1>
                    <p>The Information Technology industry is fast growing at a pace none of us are able to keep up with.
                        With this exponential growth a wide variety of tools have been provided and a need for skills to operate those tools also arose.
                        Carrying around ones's CV has now become a tedious technical burden to many and so I have sought to come up with a different approach in using tools that are available to make this said burden a little lighter by 
                        utilizing my skill set, these skills that acquired over the years are then used to better present me to my future emloyer.
                        As an undergraduate student I have acquired a variety of skills and techniques that have made it possible to me to reach this level in the field of Information Systems and have made me alot competent, driven and consistency.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>My name is Thapelo Mokhobo and I hope that this Technical CV show cases the best of integrated skill and inovation that an employer such as yourself is looking for.</p>
